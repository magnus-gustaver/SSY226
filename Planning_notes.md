Planning notes
Focusing on:
* Accuracy 
* Finding the correct position

Problems and possible solutions:
* Finding the tool 
  - Use camera, have the tool marked using color-sticker/qr-code (Possibly using the program Pixy)
  	The camera used can not use 3D-data when the object is closer than 30 cm to the camera.
	Solution to this can be to place the camera further away on the robot arm.
  - Using the information from the camera, use trajectory and path planning
* Attaching the robot to the tool
  ~~- Magnet on the tool + magnet on the robot to get the position correct~~
  	*This is not a robust solution to use in the industry due to magnets not being reliable over time.*
  - Use a graper to grab the tool

if extra time is given:
* Use an LED to show the robot is active (Why? In order to make it safer to use in collaboration with humans)

Check:
* How fast the robot is allowed to move (Why? Robot restrictions, Safefty)

Not focusing on:
* drilling
* finding the motor
