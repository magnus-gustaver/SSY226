Planning notes
Focusing on:
* Accuracy 
* Finding the correct position

Problems and possible solutions:
* Finding the tool 
  - Use camera, have the tool marked using color-sticker/qr-code (Possibly using the program Pixy)
  - trajectory and path planning
* Attaching the robot to the tool
  - Magnet on the tool + magnet on the robot to get the position correct
	- Use a graper to grab the tool

if extra time is give:
* Use an LED to show the robot is active (Why? In order to make it safer to use in collaboration with humans)

Check:
* How fast the robot is allowed to move (Why? Robot restrictions, Safefty)

Not focusing on:
* drilling
* finding the motor
