# The human, the robot and the nut runner 
# Background 
Most products are assembled manually by humans using various tools, for example nut runners. In many industries these tools are hanging in wires from the roof to make it easier for the operator to grab the tool as well as reduce the weight.   
 
The aim of this project is to implement algorithms and hardware to make it possible for both a human and a robot to take and use a nut runner that is hanging by a wire. This is an important step before robots can start collaborating with humans in production. 

# Problem description 
In this project new algorithms and hardware will be developed so that a robot can locate, attach and use a nut runner that is hanging from a wire. This include finding the exact position of tool, design a solution for attaching the robot to the tool, plan the robot motions as well as running the nut runner. 
 
This project will use ROS, the Robot Operating System, which has become the standard for robot control, together with various sensors (like 3D cameras) for finding the tool. A collaborative robot will also be used as well as a nut runner.
